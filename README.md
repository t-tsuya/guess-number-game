# guess-number-game
This project is motivated by a Recursion's course.

Guess the number the "lier" computer randomly generated!
1. To begin the game, you firstly give two integers a and b as inputs.
2. The computer randomly generates an integer x such as a <= x < b.
3. You guess the number.
4. If it is correct, you win! **The score is the number of times you answered.**
5. If it is wrong, the computer gives a hint that "x is more than or equal to your answer" or "x is less than your answer".\
   **BE CAREFUL! The computer LIES with a 20% probability!**
